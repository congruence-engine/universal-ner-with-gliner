## GLiNER notebooks

This folder contains two notebooks which lay out the approach taken by *Congruence Engine* to experimenting with fine-tuning NER models from the [GLiNER](https://github.com/urchade/GLiNER) family:
1. **gliner_synthetic_data.ipnyb**: This notebook uses a csv input to generate synthetic training data based on over 2,500 terms and definitions extracted from 19th and 20th century textile glossaries.

2. **GLiNER_finetune_notebook.ipnyb**: This notebook uses a pre-prepared dataset generated by the notebook above, and uses it to fine-tune a custom version of a GLiNER model. [Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1j1tE2bi5qrWVBKyTEgwbMISXUOvasMbs?usp=sharing).

# Universal Named Entity Recognition (NER) with GLiNER

## Short summary
This repo is intended to share the Congruence Engine’s experiments with fine-tuning a version of the GLiNER (Generalist and Lightweight Model for Named Entity Recognition) model. This model is part of a new wave of NER models commonly referred to as ‘Universal NER’ – the key distinction from traditional NER being that the model is not restricted to previously established entity types, but can entities based on user-defined labels. 



## Research question(s):
- How useful are Universal NER models in the context of museums cultural heritage?
- What kinds of linkage do these new models lead to?

The other warp is heavily weighted, and stitches through the plain face cloth. The face cloth at the stitching parts is pulled down, and the unstitched rises and forms an embossed-like surface. The second weft is used as a wadding weft, and its purpose is to make the raised figuring more pronounced. The face warp and weft are usually finer than those used for stitching and wadding and in the proportion of 2: 1, such as 2 ends 32's face 1 end 24's back.
